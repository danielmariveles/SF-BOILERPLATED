## Features
* A Sitefinity optimized port of the HTML5 Boilerplate project (http://html5boilerplate.com).
* HTML5 ready, with ARIA role definition and fall-back browser support through Modernizr
* Based on and compatible with the standard Sitefinity lay-out region editor.
* Cross browser CSS normalizations and vertical rhythm.
* Responsive design & mobile friendly with Sitefinity column support
* The latest jQuery via Sitefinity to ensure compatibility.
* Support for .LESS and .CSS.

### LESS vs CSS
Inside the App_Themes/Global directory you'll find 3 types of files, .less, .min.css and .css.
* The .min.css files are minified and production ready.
* The .css are development css files.
* The .less files are the .LESS versions with variables of the .css files.
If you're comfortable with .less, use it otherwise just delete them. If you don't need minified css, delete the .min.css files.

### Responsive design & Mobile friendly media-queries
Out of the box this theme & template are already responsive and mobile friendly. Inside the layout_transformations.css (or .less) you'll
find a print media-query already defined which is fully compatible with Sitefinity's layout editor.

### 1 column Masterpage
Inside the App_Master directory you'll find only 1 masterpage.
It is a HTML5 accessibility enhanced template based on 1 column layout, for easy alteration inside Sitefinity's layout editor. 
Header, nav, section and footer are defined with all the ARIA landmark roles. 
Complete with extra scriptwrapper placeholder which won't out on live sites so script & stylewidgets can be safely placed without breaking the PageEditor.

### Javascript & jQuery
jQuery is loaded from Sitefinity to ensure proper compatibility. Through Sitefinity settings, jQuery can be loaded locally or through CDN.
The masterpage references 2 .js files, script.top.min.js and script.bottom.min.js to separate javascript loading.
The script.top.min.js already contains the latest minified Modernizr, script.bottom.min.js is empty and ready for your projects javascript/jQuery.

### Meta-data
Meta-tags are extracted into separate MetaData.ascx to keep Masterpage clean and to allow for easier editing.
