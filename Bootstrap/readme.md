## Features
* A Sitefinity optimized extension of the Twitter Bootstrap project (https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/).
* HTML5 ready, with ARIA role definition and fallback browser support through Modernizr
* Compatible with Sitefinity's region editor
* Additional layout widgets included for Twitter Bootstrap
* Twitter Bootstrap is 'untouched' to allow for easy updating (NuGet/GitHub) or use with SASS port.

### LESS vs CSS
Inside the App_Themes/Global directory you'll find 3 types of files, .less, .min.css and .css.
* The .min.css files are minified and production ready.
* The .css are development css files.
* The .less files are the .LESS versions with variables of the .css files.
If you're comfortable with .less, use it otherwise just delete them. If you don't need minified css, delete the .min.css files.

### 1 Masterpage
Inside the App_Master directory you'll find only 1 masterpage.
It is a HTML5 accessibility enhanced template based on 1 column layout, for easy alteration inside Sitefinity's layout editor. 
Twitter Bootstrap's regions are included, section and footer are defined with all the ARIA landmark roles. 
Complete with extra scriptwrapper placeholder which won't out on live sites so script & stylewidgets can be safely placed without breaking the PageEditor.

### Javascript & jQuery
jQuery is loaded from Sitefinity to ensure proper compatibility. Through Sitefinity settings, jQuery can be loaded locally or through CDN.
The masterpage references 2 .js files, script.top.min.js and script.bottom.min.js to seperate javascript loading.
The script.top.min.js already contains the latest minified Modernizr, script.bottom.min.js is empty and ready for your projects javascript/jQuery.

### Meta-data
Meta-tags are extracted into seperate MetaData.ascx to keep Masterpage clean and to allow for easier editing.

## Sitefinity-icons
Included are all precomposed icons for the iPhone/iPad & Android devices, and Windows 8 pinning. 
The favicon.ico comes in 2 flavors. The default favicon.ico is 64x64 which is enhanced for IE9/IE10 sitepinning, an old 16x16 icon is included.
